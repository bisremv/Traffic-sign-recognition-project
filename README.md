## Features

1. **Traffic Sign Recognition**:
   - Identifies traffic signs using a trained CNN model.
   - Predicts the class of the sign and provides a confidence score.

2. **Futuristic UI**:
   - Responsive and modern design using Tkinter.
   - Dynamic resizing and easy navigation.

3. **Customizable Dataset**:
   - Built to work with the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset.
